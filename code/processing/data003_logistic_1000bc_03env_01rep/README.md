# `scripts`

- `sim_multienv_data003.jl`: Script to generate simulated a fitness measurement
  done on multiple environments throughout the growth-dilution cycles.
- `mcmc_freq.jl`: Script to sample the barcode frequency posterior distribution
  to be used as priors for the full joint inference.
- `mcmc_popmean_fitness.jl`: Script to sample the population mean fitness
  posterior distribution to be used as priors for the full joint inference.
- `mcmc_joint_fitness.jl`: Script to sample the full joint posterior
  distribution for all parameters.
