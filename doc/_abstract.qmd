The tracking of lineage frequencies via DNA barcode sequencing enables the
quantification of microbial fitness. However, experimental noise coming from
biotic and abiotic sources complicates the computation of a reliable inference.
We present a Bayesian pipeline to infer relative microbial fitness from
high-throughput lineage tracking assays. Our model accounts for multiple sources
of noise and propagates uncertainties throughout all parameters in a systematic
way. Furthermore, using modern variational inference methods based on automatic
differentiation, we are able to scale the inference to a large number of unique
barcodes. We extend this core model to analyze multi-environment assays,
replicate experiments, and barcodes linked to genotypes. On simulations, our
method recovers known parameters within posterior credible intervals. This work
provides a generalizable Bayesian framework to analyze lineage tracking
experiments. The accompanying open-source software library enables the adoption
of principled statistical methods in experimental evolution.
