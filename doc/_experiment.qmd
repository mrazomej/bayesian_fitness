## Experimental setup

Our inference pipeline is designed for the type of competition assays presented
in @kinsler2020. In these experiments, an ensemble of genotypes is pooled
together with an unlabeled reference strain that, initially, represents the vast
majority ($\geq 90\%$) of the cells in the culture. Furthermore, a subfraction
of labeled genotypes equivalent to the unlabeled reference strain---hereafter
defined as *neutral* lineages---are spiked in at a relatively high abundance
($\approx 3-5\%$), the rest of the culture being left for the ensemble of
genotypes of interest.

To determine the relative fitness of the ensemble of genotypes, a series of
growth-dilution cycles are performed on either a single or multiple
environments. In other words, the cultures are grown for some time to then
dilute the culture back into fresh media and repeat for roughly 4-6 cycles,
depending on the initial abundances of the mutants, and their relative growth
rates. The DNA barcodes are sequenced at the end of each growth cycle to
quantify the relative abundance of each of the barcodes. We point the reader to
@kinsler2020 for specific details on these assays for *S. cerevisiae*. Figure
[`ref here`] presents a typical barcode trajectory where the darker barcode
trajectories represent the neutral lineages.
